Technical Documentation
System Architecture
The architecture of the system follows a typical client-server model, where the frontend (client) interacts with the backend (server) through a REST API for data retrieval and manipulation.
Frontend (Client-side):
Built using HTML , CSS ,JAVASCRIPT .

The frontend communicates with the backend using the fetch method for the request 
   Backend (Server-side):
The backend is built using Node.js with Express.js for routing and handling API requests.
MongoDB is used as the database to store and retrieve.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for user authentication .
The backend exposes API endpoints for various operations.




Technical Specifications
Frontend:
fetch method  - To handle HTTP requests and interact with the backend.
HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT

Backend:
Node.js - JavaScript runtime for the server-side logic.
Express.js - Framework for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB - NoSQL database 

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - For secure user authentication.


Dependencies:
Jsonwebtoken: for authentication and authorization
Bcrypt for password hashing
express-validator: for validating the requests

Additional Information

Project Stages

Planning and Requirement Gathering
Activities:
Conducted initial meetings with the group members to put our ideas together to finish the website .
Created a Trello board to organize and track tasks and milestones effectively.

UI/UX Design
Activities:
Designed high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes using Figma, focusing on clean, minimalistic aesthetics aligned with fashion trends.
Developed a style guide that included color schemes, typography, and reusable components to maintain design consistency.
Ensured the design adhered to mobile-first principles, optimizing usability across devices.
Front-End Development
Activities:
Implemented a fully responsive front-end interface using html ,css,javascript 
Developed key features such as the landing page, job  listing page, and responsive navigation bar.

Back-End Development
Activities:
Set up RESTful API endpoints to support key functionalities such as user authentication, product retrieval, and order management.
Integrated MongoDB as the primary database, ensuring efficient and scalable data storage.
Documented the API for seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end components.
Integration and Testing
Activities:
Connected the front-end and back-end to enable seamless API interactions and tested functionality across critical workflows.

Developed and executed test cases using Jest and Postman to validate system performance and ensure reliability.



Challenges and Solutions
Availability 
Coordinating across team members with varying availability due to differing schedules or commitments, impacted the pace of development and required flexible planning.
Limited skills
Addressing differences in team members' expertise, as limited skills in certain areas, such as technical tools or platform development, posed challenges and required additional learning and collaboration.
Data collection and validation
Gathering accurate, reliable job market data was challenging and required careful verification to ensure trust and relevance for users. We sourced data from trusted partners and cross-checked it regularly to make sure the job listings were accurate and relevant for users.

Future Work and Lessons Learned
Future Enhancements
Introduce advanced search filters and personalized recommendation systems.
Optimize API performance for enhanced scalability.
Develop a mobile application to complement the web platform.

Lessons Learned
Allocate more buffer time for unexpected revisions and iterations.
Streamline the API testing process to reduce integration delays.
Establish consistent feedback cycles to foster strong client relationships.
